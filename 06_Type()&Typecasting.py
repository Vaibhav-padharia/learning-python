#  type function is used to find he datatype of the variable that we are going to use
# let's say
a=35
t=type (a)
print(t)
# the output wll be shown a<class int>


# now lets say
b="jay padhraia"
t=type(b)
print(t)
# here we will get the output as <class str>

# It differs with what type of variable we take as out input

#  we can also use typecasting to convert the datatype of the variable
# let's say
a="35"  #here we will get output as string as beacuse we have used double quotes for 
        # the value of a
print(type(a))
