'''
    In python we can not access the string by negative index like in other languages
    but if we want to print the last character in index -1 then 
    we can do it by prnting -1 below it that is
     print(name[-1])'''
print (name[1])
#  the above shows that by providing negative index it starts from backward where the index zero is not counted 
print(name[1:])  #this means [1:3]
