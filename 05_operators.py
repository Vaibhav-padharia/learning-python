# Arithmetic operators
a=24
b=25
print(a+b) # addition
print(a*b) # multiplication
print(a/b) # division
print(a-b) # subtraction

# Assignment operaters
a=25 # here = is a assignement operator
b=5
b+=5 # increment the value of a by 5 and then assign it to b
     # print(b)here 5 will be added to the value of b and output will be 10 
a-=2 # decrement the value of a by 2 and then assign it to b

# Comparision operators

# (here the output will always return boolean values i.e either true or false)
a==5 # here == is a comparision operator
a!=5 # here != is a comparision operator
a>5 # here > is a comparision operator
a<5 # here < is a comparision operator
a>=5 # here >= is a comparision operator
a<=5 # here <= is a comparision operator

# Logical operators
# There are some type of l0gical operators like  and, or ,not
a= True or False
b= True and True
c= not(True)
print (a)
print (b)
print (c)
